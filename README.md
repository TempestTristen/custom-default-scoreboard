# custom-default-scoreboard
This is a default/base FiveM file. No clue where the original file is but ðŸ¤·
I'm tired of the default FiveM scoreboard with its weird looking green header and stuff.. and just decided to just say fuck it and make it a bit better in my eyes and remove some unnecessary stuff to it.

### How to install:
1. **Download** the GitHub latest release file.
2. **Extract** custom-scoreboard.
3. **Put** the custom-default-scoreboard file inside your **'resources'** folder.
4. Add **`ensure custom-scoreboard`** to your server.cfg

#### Notice:
* I honestly donâ€™t give 2 shits if you change the code in your own server or reupload as long as itâ€™s different from this. Maybe just link this so people know its originality.
* This resource is free. Why have this shit paid? Lmao took me 5 minutes.
