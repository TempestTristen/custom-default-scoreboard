# custom-default-scoreboard created by Tristen
This is a default/base FiveM file. No clue where the original file is but ðŸ¤·
I'm tired of the default FiveM scoreboard with its weird looking green header and stuff.. and just decided to just say fuck it and make it a bit better in my eyes and remove some unnecessary stuff to it.


### How to install:
1. Download the GitHub latest release file.
2. Extract custom-scoreboard.
3. Put custom-scoreboard file inside your 'resources' folder.
4. Add **ensure custom-scorebard** to your server.cfg
